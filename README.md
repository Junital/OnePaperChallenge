# One Paper Challenge

This is a challenge for me. To confirm the specific study domain that I am interested in, I need to read enough papers. In the mean while, I hope my paper notes can help you to learn relevent studies, although they basically are Chinese.

Here are some model structures:

|Model|Structure|
|---|---|
|DaSL(Dynamic Auxiliary Soft Labels)|![DaSL](./1.%20Img/DaSL.png)|
|$\text{TR}^2$|![TR2](./1.%20Img/TR2%20framework.png)|
|Single-Stage Grasp(SSG)|![SSG](./1.%20Img/SSGfig1.png)|
|AugRmixAT|![AugRmixAT](./1.%20Img/AugRmixAT.png)|
